# Commit Message Helper

When writing commit messages, follow these rules:

## Format

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>

## Types

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Guidelines

1. Subject line should be no longer than 50 characters
2. Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
3. Do not end the subject line with a period
4. Separate subject from body with a blank line
5. Use the body to explain what and why, not how

## Examples

Good:
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow to allow users to log in
with their Google or GitHub accounts.

Closes #123

Bad:
updated stuff

## Validation

Before committing, run the validation script to check the format:

python scripts/validate_commit.py "your commit message"
